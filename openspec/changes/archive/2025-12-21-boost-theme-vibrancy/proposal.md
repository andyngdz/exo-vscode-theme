# Change: Boost Theme Vibrancy

## Why

User feedback indicates themes look "sleepy" - colors are too muted and lack energy. While the eye-friendly approach is good for backgrounds, syntax colors need more vibrancy to feel alive and engaging during coding sessions.

## What Changes

- Increase saturation on all syntax colors by ~30-40% across all 5 themes
- Make accent/primary colors more vivid
- Keep backgrounds muted (maintain eye comfort for large surfaces)
- Maintain each theme's unique identity while boosting energy

## Impact

- Affected specs: `theme-system` (color guidelines)
- Affected code: All palette files (`src/palettes/*.ts`)
- User experience: More vibrant, energetic themes that still maintain eye comfort
