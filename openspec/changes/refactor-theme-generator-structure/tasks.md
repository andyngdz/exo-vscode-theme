## 1. Proposal-Driven Implementation Plan

- [x] 1.1 Add small helper builders for `colors` sections (Editor, Sidebar, Lists, etc.)
- [x] 1.2 Add small helper builders for `tokenColors` sections (Core, JSON, Markdown)
- [x] 1.3 Extract shared scope arrays into named constants
- [x] 1.4 Preserve token rule order and settings exactly
- [x] 1.5 Run `pnpm run build` and verify generated `themes/*.json` diffs are empty (or only expected formatting changes)
- [x] 1.6 If diffs exist, explain and correct to preserve behavior
